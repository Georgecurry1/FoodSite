NOTES PLEASE READ: the idea is to get the data from the quiz and do a search of that keyword of all places around and find directions to one of them
This is not currently duable right now because the amount of data required from that search could charge me in real currency because you
have to pay to use google's resources. So after the user takes the quiz, they get their orgin from current location, and their destination
is not based on their data from quiz yet. It is instead based on troy uni. This is a place holder just to complete the assignment.

User takes a quiz to figure out where they want to eat. When finished, they are prompted with the answer and that answer is used to find the destination of said place.
website will get the user location and get the route to the destination on google maps.
